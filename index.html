    <h2>Welcome on Oscar&#39;s Spray Painting Website!</h2>
    <p>Oscar is created by four students, with the purpose to fight against littering.
        Oscar will encourage you to pick up your trash, and put it in Oscar&#39s special bin,
        which has magical-like powers! 
        When litter has been thrown into the bin, you'll get the ability to put spray paint on the train!  
        But wait, where does your art go to? 
        Well, to this site!
